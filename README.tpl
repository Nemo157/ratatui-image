Halfblocks should work in all terminals.

### Comparison:

* [viuer](https://crates.io/crates/viuer)
  Renders graphics in different terminals/protocols, but "dumps" the image, making it difficult to
  work for TUI programs.
  The terminal protocol guessing code has been adapted to rustix, thus the author of viuer is
  included in the copyright notice.
* [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
  Not a library but a terminal file manager that implementes many graphics protocols and lets you
  preview images in the filesystem.
* [Überzug++](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp)
  CLI utility that draws images on terminals by using X11/wayland child windows, sixels, kitty
  and/or iterm2 protocols. There exists several wrapper or bindings crates.
